      <p className="m-0">
        I am a Civil Engineer and my professional career can be summarized in
        civil engineering related jobs. However, I have decided to challenge
        myself and learn something new, like coding. ðŸ’»
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="m-0">
        I have always enjoyed computers, games and technology, so I thought "Why
        not try coding? ", and so, I did. I have been teaching myself coding for
        web development for a while and now, with CoGrammar bootcamp, I am
        aiming to improve my skills to a competitive level and achieve my first
        job in the tech industry.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="m-0">
        I am motivated to learn new technologies, always in constant
        professional development, quickly learning problem-solving, with great
        interest in web-dev.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="m-0">
        A bit more about me is that I was born and raised in Brazil and I
        consider myself a good and simple person. In my free time you will
        probably find me watching a good movie, playing a game on my computer or
        studying coding.
